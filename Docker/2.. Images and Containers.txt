====== IMAGES AND CONTAINERS =========
Images:- are templates of project
Containers:- Running instance of Image.. 


=============== IMAGES
- It is kind of ready to use software read-only template
- Images is made with source code, libraries, external dependencies , and tools
- Images can not be updated
- If we want to make change in image we have to create new image
- Images can not run directly .. 

Example: 
- Application tool and libraries
- Node js setup
- React setup
- Code of application
- Dependencies
- any other supporting tool
- docker file too

============== CONTAINER 

- Runnable instance of Image
- The container is a process that runs application with images
- Container is an isolated process
Means container run independently on computer
